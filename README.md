Customer Segmentation Project
This project involves customer segmentation using various clustering techniques. The goal is to group customers based on their behavior and characteristics. The project includes preprocessing of the raw dataset, visualization of scatter plots in 2D and 3D, determination of the optimal number of clusters (k), and clustering using k-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering algorithms. The performance of the clusters is analyzed using silhouette and CH scores.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including various features that can be used for segmentation.

Preprocessing
Before clustering, the raw dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables if necessary. This ensures that the data is ready for clustering algorithms.

Visualization
Scatter Plot (2D): Visualizing the dataset in 2D space to identify potential clusters. Features selected for the plot are [feature1] and [feature2].

Scatter Plot (3D): Visualizing the dataset in 3D space for a more comprehensive view. Features selected for the plot are [feature1], [feature2], and [feature3].

Clustering
Determination of k: Using the elbow method and silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for k-means clustering. Clustering Algorithms:

K-means: Applying the k-means algorithm with the optimal k. DBSCAN: Applying the DBSCAN algorithm for density-based clustering. Hierarchical Clustering: Applying hierarchical clustering to capture hierarchical relationships in the data.

Performance Analysis
Silhouette Score: Calculating silhouette scores for each clustering algorithm to measure the quality of the clusters.

Calinski-Harabasz Score: Calculating CH scores for each clustering algorithm to assess the compactness and separation of clusters.
